#### Personal Budget Manager 

The app allows adding two types of trasactions: expense and income. For each transaction the user can associate a category. 
The app has a few default categories when installed, but the user can define their own. 
The app provides 2 reports: one with 2 pie charts that show the user how much they spent on each category of expense/income and one 
that provides totals for expenses and incomes, a balance and a percentage of income spent.
